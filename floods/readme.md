# EcoAlert
Our project addresses the critical need to predict natural disasters—specifically wildfires, floods, earthquakes, and landslides—using advanced machine learning models trained on historical data. Each model is designed to recognize patterns and risks unique to each type of disaster, providing a proactive approach to protecting communities at risk.

# Disaster Prediction Models: Focused and Specialized
To accurately predict each type of natural disaster, we developed specialized machine learning models capable of identifying risk factors specific to:
- Wildfires: Analyzing fire-prone areas based on historical wildfire patterns and environmental factors.
- Floods: Leveraging terrain and moisture data to detect conditions conducive to flooding.
- Earthquakes: Identifying seismic activity patterns to assess potential earthquake risks.
- Landslides: Recognizing slopes and areas with high soil moisture, rainfall patterns, and geological factors to anticipate landslide risks.
  
These specialized models allow for precise risk identification, making our predictions more reliable and tailored to the specific characteristics of each disaster type.


# Real-Time Data Integration from Google Earth Engine (GEE)
Our system enhances the effectiveness of predictions by integrating real-time satellite data from Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE provides critical environmental data, which allows us to track the disaster risks.The integration of historical data with real-time environmental monitoring enables our models to dynamically adjust risk assessments based on the most current conditions, enhancing both accuracy and responsiveness.
# Alert System: Prompt and Accessible Notifications
A critical feature of our system is its alert mechanism, designed to promptly notify users of impending threats. Notifications sent directly to users’ devices, ensuring timely warnings, even without internet connectivity.
